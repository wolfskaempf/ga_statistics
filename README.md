# ga_statistics
Catering all the statistics lovers of the European Youth Parliament

#Attention!
The project is now continued inside of the eyp-developers organisation. You can find it here: https://github.com/eyp-developers/statistics

Welcome! We aim to provide a reusable GA Statistics app that can be used on any given session with any set of committees. It's completely open source and uses [Python](http://python.org) in conjunction with the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Is `ga_statistics` ready to be used?

Yes, but you can still help to improve it! Contact @wolfskaempf or just start working on any of the [Issues](https://github.com/wolfskaempf/ga_statistics/issues) currently open and send a pull request when you're finished.

## What does it look like at the moment?

It is possible to add any set of committees which will be displayed in conjunction with the finished statistics modules. At the moment point resumes can be submitted to be displayed as part of the committees individual page. These are automatically updated as Chairs submit them.

You can view a more or less frequently updated version of the most recent commit [here](http://gastatistics.wiesenblu.me). You can log in to the admin interface [here](http://gastatistics.wiesenblu.me/admin). Username "tom" and password "a" will work.

## I don't know how I got here, what is all of this?

If you don't know what the `EYP` (European Youth Parliament) is, read through our [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Youth_Parliament) or visit our [website](http://eypej.org).

Every time the people who are part of this organisation gather for a large event, a part of this event is called the `GA`. It stands for [General Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_assembly) and it's exactly that. During the `GA` the participants will discuss different topics in various manners. We designed `ga_statistics` to keep track of all of this data and make it nice and easy to collect and display it.
